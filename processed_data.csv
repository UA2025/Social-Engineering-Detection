Hettinga"" Subject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation Sender: http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jspPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002 Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulationBy Dan Gillmor Mercury News Technology ColumnistThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices.And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.''How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things -- including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, non-renewable energy sources.If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities -- tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to inject real competition into the market.We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation is essential.But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of both.The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer ideas isn't enough.The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether.Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming war in Iraq goes badly.It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next year.-- ----------------- R. A.

2002"" (S. 2395, also known as ""the Biden Bill""). It started as an
attempt to stop organized crime from forging holograms and
counterfeiting money, but its scope has been greatly expanded to
include digital watermarks on copyrighted material. This is a sneaky
power-grab that would greatly diminish the rights of the public in
copyrighted works while expanding the power of copyright owners. It
goes well beyond the scope of current copyright law and could:~ Prevent universities, libraries, and consumers from enjoying the
exceptions to the Copyright Act adopted by Congress. S. 2935 could
prohibit the use of interface information essential for software
interoperability and competition~ Impose new responsibilities on Internet service providers and could
also require consumer electronics and computer manufacturers to
reconfigure their products.~ Impose more severe criminal and civil penalties than permitted by
the Copyright Act for identical behaviorThis ""anticounterfeiting"" bill is a decoy; stand up for your rights
today! Subscribe to the EFF Action Center and send your member of
Congress an email, letter or fax. You can take action by going to:http://action.eff.org/action/index.asp?step=2&item=2274Join EFF! For membership information see:
http://www.eff.org/support/-=end=-----------------------------------------------------------* Canadian Trademark Law OverreachingEFF has been involved in several cases involving overreaching
trademark claims on the Internet. Recently we have learned about a
Canadian lawsuit over the website www.lawsnet.com, a nonprofit legal
information website focusing on the laws of Canada and China that seem
especially egregious.Lawsnet.com is a free legal information website that has been
published since 1998. Last year, Lawsnet.com's owner Ling Xia was sued
by Quicklaw, a subsidiary of global publishing giant LexisNexus Group.
Quicklaw claims that Lawsnet.com violates its rights in the name
LAW/NET. However, LAW/NET does not have a public Internet website
under that domain name. The name appears on a subsidiary webpage of
the Quicklaw.com website that offers public ""teasers"" in the form of
summaries of recent Canadian cases, with the full text only available
through the private, proprietary paid Quicklaw service for Canadian
lawyers. It seems clear that the two names are substantially
different, are used in different places (one as a teaser for a closed
computer service and the other for information freely available on the
public internet) and are not causing any consumer confusion. Even more
problematic, Quicklaw does not even have a Canadian trademark in the
term LAW/NET -- it applied for one in 1997 but has repeatedly filed
requests for extensions of time with the Canadian trademark
authorities. In contrast, Ms. Xia is in the final stages of having a
Canadian trademark issued for ""lawsnet.""Regardless of its weak case, Quicklaw has managed to drag Ms. Xia
through over a year of litigation and recently succeeded in securing a
court order requiring her to undergo an extensive ""discovery"" process
that threatens to drive her under. Although she has had some free
legal assistance in the past, this next phase will require
significantly more legal resources than her volunteer attorneys can
muster. Quicklaw is represented by a large Toronto firm, Borden Ladner
and Gervais, LLP.Abuse of trademark law (even here, when no official trademark has even
been granted) is a growing problem on the Internet, and it is
unfortunately becoming an international problem. EFF urges Quicklaw,
and its US-based parent company, to stop beating up on this free and
useful website. While trademark law is important when misuse of a mark
is causing consumer confusion, it does not -- and should not -- grant
ownership in words, especially descriptive words like ""laws"" and ""net""
when describing an online legal information service. Trademark law
should also not be a license for large corporations who sell legal
information (or any other nonproprietary information) to stop
individuals who want to use the power of the Internet to provide free
legal information to the public.For those who wish to help Ms. Xia directly, local Toronto lawyer and
part-time law professor Gil Lan has agreed to act as trustee for a
legal defence fund to be established for Ms. Xia. If you wish to help,
please contact:Mr. Gil Lan

kratzer    many questions still need to be answered before a sufficiently adequate analysis can be developed  as for argument structure  it should be asked what evidence we have that each modal has

those that have a negative or affirmative import  such as english  only  or french  bien   it seems that such focus particles can alter the syntactic and semantic behaviour of modals  the  scopal  interaction of modals with other quantifiers and modals with question operators is also in need of a better description and analysis  it has been claimed that question formation and epistemic modality exclude each other  although this does not seem to hold in general  question formation and epistemic modality do seem to restrict each other in ways that are poorly understood  the interaction of modal verbs with modal adverbials is also relevant for the determination of the syntactic position of modals  particulary in view of cinque s    hypothesis that every sentence contains two modal

"Thanks Brent: now it's clearer (to me) what's needed. I've used the global
sort and J C Lawrence's re-scan, but there is still a vulnerability there:
If I have an instance of exmh running, the folder I'm visiting will have
its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch
folders. I can cron the sort and re-scan process, but I should kill running
exmh's first.Best would be to have a button for ""Global sort and update all scan caches""
in the exmh More... menu--

  TP> headers.I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:> Dear Sir/Madam,
> 
> May I please take some of your precious time to ask you to help me to find a
> solution to a problem that is worrying me greatly. I am old science studentI guess that reads a lot like spam :-(.Jeremy

"closing linguistics at soas call for help ! ! ! soas department of phonetics and linguistics to be closed in october 1992 dear colleagues , on tuesday may 19 , dr david bennett , head of our department , was told that we would cease functioning as of october of this year . we are a department of the school of oriental and african studies of the university of london . the members of our department are : dr david bennett prof thea bynon dr wynn chao dr monik charette dr katrina hayward dr richard hayward * dr george hewitt * * dr bruce ingham prof jonathan kaye prof ruth kempson * cross appointed with the africa department * * cross appointed with the near and middle east department our department offers degrees at the ba , ma , mphil and phd level . approximately 60 students , mostly at the postgraduate level are enrolled . many other students , particularly from university college , london ( ucl ) take courses with us . we run an ma - linguistics and an ma - phonetics programme jointly with ucl . we also have an ma in english - arabic applied linguistics and translation together with birbeck college . all these programmes will of course be affected by this decision . the department of phonetics and linguistics is the oldest linguistic department in the u . k . it was the home of the "" london school "" which received worldwide attention under the intellectual leadership of prof jr firth . his chair , which i occupy today , was the first chair of linguistics in the u . k . over the years our graduates have distinguished themselves in many areas of linguistics . later postings will provide a partial list of the more well known soas graduates . it is acknowledged , even by the administration of soas , that we remain a centre of academic excellence in our field . the decision to close the soas linguistics department was made with no consultation , no advanced warning . it was a result of discussions by the governing body of the school , the finance and general purposes committee and the management committee . there is no linguistic representation on any of these bodies . the reasons given for closing the department are : ( 1 ) severe budget cuts ( 2 ) our low number of undergraduate students ( 3 ) the "" general perception "" that our department is not well integrated into the school . it was stated that , among the options considered closing our department would cause the "" least harm "" to the school . no one was present to represent the linguistics side of the story . this decision will be presented to the academic board of the school on wednesday may 27 . the academic board has an advisory role only but we are hoping to mobilise school opinion against this decision . unlike similar cases in other countries , most of the members of our department will not be redeployed elsewhere in the school . recent legislation has virtually destroyed the notion of tenure in the u . k . many of us are facing "" premature retirement "" , "" redundancy "" or some form of "" severance "" agreement . the administration of the school seems to feel that we will easily find jobs and that terminating our employment at the school will cause us no undue hardships . given the administration 's figures for the cost of severing their relation with us , the offers that we are likely to receive from the school will not be very attractive . as of now , no statement has been forthcoming about our future at the school but the director has stated that he will be meeting with us individually next week . we will keep you posted on this aspect . if you would like to do something to try and help us stop the closing of our department , please send ( in order of preference ) a fax or a letter to me at the address and fax number given below . if possible use your institution 's letterhead . please feel free to make comments about our department as a whole or about individual members with whose work or reputation you are familiar . pass this message along to your colleagues and encourage them to write as well . if you feel so inclined , departmental resolutions reflecting your opinion of this event would be quite helpful . i hope to be able to arrive at next wednesday 's meeting with an armful of your letters ( copies of all letters will be sent to our director ) and your support will do a lot to improve our spirits . this will be a long and difficult struggle both for our department and for our jobs and careers . thank you in advance for listening and for your support . jonathan kaye professor of general linguistics department of phonetics & linguistics school of oriental and african studies thornhaugh street , russell square london , wc1h 0xg u . k . e-mail : jk @ ukacrl . earn jk @ uk . ac . rl . ib ( janet ) fax number : ( 44 ) + 71-436 -

Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.""Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
that morning.He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.""Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.12:27 Tuesday 8th October 2002_________________________________________________________________

Some interesting quotes...http://www.postfun.com/pfp/worbois.html
Thomas Jefferson:""I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not
find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature.
They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent
men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been
burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this
coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites;
to support roguery and error all over the earth.""SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,
by John E. Remsburg, letter to William Short
Jefferson again:""Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on
man. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the
teachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, the
first great corrupter of the teaching of Jesus.""

Is there a relatively clean way to dynamically build comp files based on
the path of the current folder?  Yeah, I know exmh will pull the first comp in the path up from the
  current folder to the mail root, but that's not what I want.I'm starting to use plus addressing heavily as part of my SPAM controls.
Specifically I each mailing list with a list-specific address.  eg I would subscribe to this list as claw+exmh@kanga.nu or perhaps
  claw+exmh-users@kanga.nu instead of claw@kanga.nuHowever to do this I need a new set of comp files for each list folder.
As I'm subscribed to something just over 600 lists, that's rather a
pain.  I really don't want to go create and maintain ~1,800 comp files
(components, replcomps, replgroupcomps), especially not as I suspect
I'll be changing or adapting my naming pattern a few times as I adapt
various supporting tools.What would be great is if I could build the relevant comp file
dynamically at runtime.  That way I don't need to maintain a couple
thousand comp files, I just need to make my plus addresses
predictable/computable based (say) on the folder path.  eg I'm currently in folder:    +-Lists-/Products/Exmh-L    The script would dynamically build a compfile which had a From: of
    claw+exmh@kanga.nu for repl, comp, etc.  Similarly when in folder:    +-Lists-/Linux/SVLUG-L  I'd get a From: of claw+svlug@kanga.nuThat way I can use lookup tables for those folders which have multiple
lists being delivered into them.Any ideas how this might be done in an automatic/maintainable fashion?
It would be more than good enough if all I had to do was drop a tiny
FROM_HEADER file in each folder that somehow got picked up by the comp
file...--

This is remarkable for its lack of newsworthiness.1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed.

psychic intelligence to guard  their eggs and young and who probably preferred to live underground they  survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs  million years ago with difficulty  they evolved into the erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet  for them possibly with the help of another race of ets who wanted slaves  but otherwise had no interest in earth or mind control   thus it appears that the current reptoids are the spirits or ghosts of the  dinosaurs they must have been powerful to survive  million years and also  to appear to some people they have appeared to the writer in remote  viewing they are living on as vampire entities such immortal minds are  contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers if they can be  encouraged to reincarnate then the power sources of the black magicians and  mind controllers will disappear encouraging them to reincarnate will help  so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great  difficulty surviving reincarnation purging peoples dinosaurs should remove  all perverse psychic abilities not under their control they are a source of  satanic guardian angels and demons they control us by owning our psi thus  if we regain ownership of psi we must relinquish their control and that of  all other mind controllers encourage people to regain ownership of their  psi   the origins of love hate and pure malice the following scenario appears to  hold water and can account for the origins of our universal subconscious   dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of  rotting vegetation a good source of beetles and grubs for young  hatchelings they did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm which made  them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change in order to  keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control to do this  they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators this is an  act of hatred and outward looking while a few dinosaurs did develop the  ability to bear living young most did not the dinosaurs got in first and  so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds they have  become the source of all satans devils and demons   birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep  them warm a hen bird normally lays a series of eggs say one per day and  only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid thus all eggs tend  to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth this is  primarily an act of love but inward looking bearing live young is not  suitable to a bird of the air a pregnant pigeon would not fly very far  antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm  even if they are standing on ice   mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act  of love and inward looking this is especially true as a mammalian female  can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird  sitting on a nest   dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young  while birds and mammals developed love birds and mammals certainly do hate  all enemies of their young but this is secondary   if one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician then  purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs unfortunately most of our  religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control  regardless of the front they put out to the public religion tends to  concentrate on how to brainwash your neighbour conscious thought has  built many mighty empires theologies and slave control systems out of using  how to care for and protect ones young as a foundation   thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something a load of  dinosaurs eggs purging the dinosaurs and dinosaurs eggs of any entity  tends to purge all malice back to its roots   it looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings  aided and abetted by various occultists and other as they will insist on  vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the  serenity of the writer he encourages them to reincarnate   items for inspection for mind control to take place then someone must take  control or ownership of the targets psi and pleasure centres check for the  following   nest of dinosaurs eggs holy dinosaurs etc  eggs controllers or owners in peoples psi pleasure centres pain killing  hormones abilities etc  mind machines  the original engraving or engram  god and satan appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right t  hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams no doubt dinosaurs were the  first job holders  timetracks are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of  time   my our mans timetracks etc  the time tracks of the universe universal subconscious galactic  subconscious etc  extinct races of ets can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode  their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices whenever  one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes suspect that the  higher plane is a vampire one one may never know what they looked like or  other basic characteristics which makes linking back a trifle difficult  every extinct race etc  blood ancestors are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via  genetic linkages some of these can be over  years old  every blood ancestor ancestral mind genetic mind etc ,1

Date: Not suppliedA San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 
    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request...     So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.  Link[1] Discuss[2] (_via CamWorld[3]_)[1] http://www.bradnewsham.com/articles/why_so_hard.shtml

 Dear readers,The majority of PC users may run Windows, but Microsoft can't
touch the passion that Mac users bring to computing. This week,
Apple devotees gathered in New York to find out what their guru,
Steve Jobs, has in store for them. They were not disappointed,
with offerings ranging from the new iMacs, which continue to push
the boundaries of the PC form factor, to updated iPods that
include more memory, better menus, and compatibility with
Windows. Read the 
full coverage from 
CNET's News.com.

PIMs on the side
Whatever happened to the straightforward, dedicated PIM?
   PIM/contact managers, such as the ubiquitous Outlook and
   Lotus, pushed them to the sidelines. But a few PIMs survived
   this enforced obscurity. If you need a plain PIM that doesn't
   cost a fortune, one of these may tickle your fancy.

More in wireless phonesÂ Readers mourn Gene Kan
Peer-to-peer pioneer dies, Macworld kicks off in Manhattan, and
the PayPal/eBay merger is not going so well.--Laura Lindhe, executive editor, CNET Tech Trends
1
Gene Kan:   Gnutella open-source guru Gene Kan, who died on June
   29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the CNET
   community. Last week, search requests for information on
   25-year-old Kan far outweighed the kind of requests on
   products and companies I usually see. A pioneer in the
   peer-to-peer space, many credit him with legitimizing file
   sharing--making it about more than music, according to Wired
   News.
2
Macworld:   The annual Apple lovefest in New York is always a
   good show, whether or not Steve Jobs has anything real to
   announce. So far, it looks like Apple has already surprised a
   few by announcing the release of QuickTime 6.0 (see No. 7),
   which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing
   quagmire.
   3
PayPal:
   
   It's been a rocky road thus far for the eBay and
   PayPal deal. Soon after eBay announced it was buying PayPal
   for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit claiming that
   PayPal's price tag was too low. This week, PayPal is being
   subpoenaed by the New York attorney general in regard to its
   involvement with online gambling transactions.
   4
Wi-Fi:   I'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up
   on the Buzz Meter permanently. This time, Wi-Fi is getting
   interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights,
   including Intel, AT&T Wireless, and Verizon Communications, to
   build wireless access places across the nation in public areas
   where people would want to launch onto the Net, such as
   airports.
5
eMac:   This is the for-education-only computer that consumers
   wanted so badly that Apple released it to them. The CNET
   review is out, and here's the word: the eMac is what the iMac
   used to be. Basically, it's an easy-to-use, fairly inexpensive
   computer for users who don't need to do much besides word
   processing and accessing the Web.

The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, and present information that is highly in demand by the market.Apart from the core print and electronic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, such as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and training in the field of wealth management and personal finance.These areas are closely linked to the core competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands that they have built to further drive the growth potential.CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Republic of China. In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direct management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Development Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.HIGHLIGHTS:May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Exclusive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish, Internationally.February 2002, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market research provider.March 2002, CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique financial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of China.Â May 7, 2002, CXIN announces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket company and the leading provider of emerging market securities.May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President, Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China Morning Post and Asia Magazine.June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling subscriptions.June 24, 2002, CXIN announces the acquisition ofÂ  Smart Investor Magazine and related business. This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consolidated revenues.Â July 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, one of the worlds largest aggregators.INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, which analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 years to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this industry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchandise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well positioned to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing Chinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted by the Chinese government provide the company with an ""unfair advantage"" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent license agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will enable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Million within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancing, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue and profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sector CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and above this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.Disclaimer: The Wall Street Weekly provides information on selected companies that it believes has investment potential.

morphology : inflection and derivation paradigms - word order variation - syntactic variation - syntax and semantics - diachronic studies - comparative studies - chamito-semitic languages and universal grammar - minimalist approaches to chamito-semitic languages - the acquisition of morphosyntax chamito - semitic languages have generally been associated with descriptive and diachronic linguistics . they have been described and analyzed at the phonological , morphosyntactic and semantic levels by functional , structural and generative schools of linguistics . today most chamito - semitic studies are inspired by the generative trend . however , in the light of the new developments in the minimalist theory , chamito - semitic languages have been overlooked . the aim of this conference is to discuss new researches in the syntax of chamito - semitic languages within the framework of the latest approaches in generative syntax . the ultimate goal is to establish the parameters of these languages and bring changes and improvements to the minimalist theory on the basis of empirical data . new data and comparative studies are encouraged in order to strengthen or disconfirm the principles of minimalism and ug . this conference will focus on similarities and differences between the various chamito - semitic languages , using the minimalist theoretical framework and empirical knowledge . comparisons between dialects and languages that are genetically related will be made to check parametrization in ug , on the one hand , and to analyze the syntax of these languages on formal grounds . the major aim of this conference , then , is to shed light on the progress made in chamito - semitic morphology and syntax , as well as focus on the data and theoretical perspectives . contributions from related subjects like semantics , language variation and language acquisition will be welcome . hypotheses and predictions will be postulated and tested according to different principles and parameters determined by ug . for further contacts , please e-mail : ennaji < estry @ fesnet . net . ma >",Safe Email,chamito  semitic conference announcing the  conference on the morpho  syntax of chamito  semitic languages to be held at the university of fez  morocco  march     deadline for receipt of abstracts  november    all submissions must comprise  i  three copies of the abstract and ii  one card with full name  affiliation  title of the paper  address  fax number and email  the paper abstracts must be at most   pages long  including examples and references   papers will be presented in english  french and arabic  authors whose abstracts are accepted will be notified in mid  january   the abstract may be sent by surface mail  fax or email to  professor moha ennaji for the generative grammar reseach group  gergg  sidi moahmed ben abdellah university faculty of letters  department of english bp  fs   morocco tel        fax        e  mail  ennaji  there will be  talks in all  each  minutes long with an additional  minutes for discussion  the university can pay for board and lodging during the conference  but cannot afford to pay for transportation  participants are requested to make their travel arrangements early  as a follow up to this conference  a threeday spring institute will be organized on march    for the benefit of graduate students and researchers  this miniinstitute will feature lectures and seminars on minimalist theory and the morphology and syntax of chamitosemitic languages  invited leading scholars in the field will teach a few courses  conference topics and aims the major suggested topics to be discussed during the conference are   morphology  inflection and derivation paradigms  word order variation  syntactic variation  syntax and semantics  diachronic studies  comparative studies  chamitosemitic languages and universal grammar  minimalist approaches to chamitosemitic languages  the acquisition of morphosyntax chamito  semitic languages have generally been associated with descriptive and diachronic linguistics  they have been described and analyzed at the phonological  morphosyntactic and semantic levels by functional  structural and generative schools of linguistics  today most chamito  semitic studies are inspired by the generative trend  however  in the light of the new developments in the minimalist theory  chamito  semitic languages have been overlooked  the aim of this conference is to discuss new researches in the syntax of chamito  semitic languages within the framework of the latest approaches in generative syntax  the ultimate goal is to establish the parameters of these languages and bring changes and improvements to the minimalist theory on the basis of empirical data  new data and comparative studies are encouraged in order to strengthen or disconfirm the principles of minimalism and ug  this conference will focus on similarities and differences between the various chamito  semitic languages  using the minimalist theoretical framework and empirical knowledge  comparisons between dialects and languages that are genetically related will be made to check parametrization in ug  on the one hand  and to analyze the syntax of these languages on formal grounds  the major aim of this conference  then  is to shed light on the progress made in chamito  semitic morphology and syntax  as well as focus on the data and theoretical perspectives  contributions from related subjects like semantics  language variation and language acquisition will be welcome  hypotheses and predictions will be postulated and tested according to different principles and parameters determined by ug  for further contacts  please email  ennaji ,0

"Dear Sir, 
With due respect and humility I write you this letter which I believe you
would
be of great assistance to my children and I.
I got your contact through my husband commercial address book and believed
that
you must be a trust worthy and reliable person that will not like to
intimidate me
or betray my trust after hearing this news. I am a native of KONOBO in the
KEREMA
local district of SIERRA LEONE in West Africa and the wife of Late DR.
MUNDI A.
KOJO who was assassinated by the rebel forced loyal to Major John Paul
Koromah
because he was the Director General National Gold and Diamond Mining
Corporation
of Sierra Leone. Few days before my husband was assassinated, he 
instructed me
and my children (Ibrahim and Amina) to move out of Sierra Leone immediately,
before the powerful Economic community of West African States (ECOMOG)
forces
intervened, which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. My children
and I
managed to escape to Togo through the help of my husband's friend. We came
into
Togo with some valuables including a cash sum of $25MILLION(TWENTY FIVE
MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in two trunks boxes which I have deposited
with a
Trust Company here in Togo and special arrangement has been made with the
currier
company who will freight the money to your country.
Meanwhile, I want to leave Togo entirely with this money for investment in
your
country because of a stable political situation there and mostly for the
future of
my children. I want you to please assist us to claim this fund from the
Trust
Company in any of their branches in Europe, after which the fund will be
deposited
into your account for investment in your country. You should also help us to
source for good investment opportunity so that we can invest wisely in your
country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.
We have it in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance as we have
resolved to give you 20% of the total sum for your help. But due to how I
am being
monitored by the Sierra Leonean Government Secret Agents, I will advice
you to
have the 
deal concluded with my son (IBRAHIM KOJO). Please contact my son on this
email:
ibrahimkojo@caramail.com , immediately you receive this letter to enable us
proceed in earnest towards retrieving the consignments and transferring
same into
your account.
Your private Fax and Phone is needed in this transaction for private

"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,781616,00.htmlBritons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in EuropeJohn Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The GuardianNot every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.------------------------ Yahoo! Groups Sponsor ---------------------~-->

"Here's a weird and wacky problem:I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?Cheers,
Waider.

downloaded the file.  Also it might complain of a few dependencies but
you can get these at freshrpms.net, except for gcc3, which you can find

the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""
Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.Barbara ""ears of corn"" MikkelsonLast updated:   29 July 2002http://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork",Safe Email,"on thu aug   at pm  robert harley wrote

Forwarded by: Gary Williams A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" Mom fainted.

By Denis MuellerAt the end of World War II, the United States was a rigidly 
segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show. 
In 1946, the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated 
seating on interstate transportation was illegal. In 1947, 
the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) decided to challenge 
the racist system. The opposition was fierce and the riders 
were jailed often ending up on chain gangs.By 1961, the time was right to challenge America's Jim Crow 
laws and CORE proposed the ""Freedom Rides."" CORE felt that 
they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby 
creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to 
intervene to enforce the law. It would be dangerous and CORE 
members knew that they were risking their lives, but as CORE 
director James Farmer maintained they were ready.  ""When we 
began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much 
violence as could be thrown at us. We were prepared for the 
possibility of death.""

AOL Users Click Here------------------------------------------------------------ On May 4th, 1961 they set out to New Orleans. In the upper 
south they met no resistance but by the time they got to 
Alabama they were met by an angry band of terrorists who 
slashed the tires and burned the bus. In Birmingham it was 
worse. The FBI, through its informant James Rowe, were well 
aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them. So were 
the Birmingham police, led by Chief of police Bull Conner, 
and when they arrived they were severely beaten. Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them. 
Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders. 
So the terrorist attacks went on. The ""Freedom Riders"" were 
determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash-
ville students. They were met by hostility and were arrested 
and sent back to Tennessee. But the riders were fearless and 
immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the 
journey.------------------------------------------------------------    ---------> The Paranormal Insider Is Here! <---------ShagMail is PROUD to introduce our one and only paranormal 
investigator, Gus. Once a week he will explore the most 
intriguing cases of paranormal incidents reported. ESP, alien 
sightings, angels, ghosts and much more. Every issue is a gem!

""Freedom Riders"" left Birmingham on May 20th determined to 
continue. State officials had promised Attorney General Robert 
Kennedy they would be protected, but by the time they reached 
Montgomery there were no state police in sight. Seeing a mob, 
the riders feared for their lives, but Jim Zwerg, a white man, 
bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death. 
He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un-
deniable. Others including Justice Department official John 
Seigenthaler were also beaten.The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter-
vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar-
ing martial law. Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off 
period but the riders refused. They would continue on. So 
they set off to Jackson, Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a 
deal with Mississippi officials. They were supposed to be 
protected, but upon arriving they were arrested. Kennedy had 
caved in. It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General 
and the riders were sentenced for 60 days for exercising 
their constitutional rights. They never finished their trip 
but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and 
in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be 
defeated. It is another example of how people change things, 
not government officials.Sources: Eyes on the Prize------------------------------------------------------------

 Try installing the latest Perl (at least 5.6.1) port on Freebsd and make

"Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some 
Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   
Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was 
originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more 
sensibly it would have been a lot harder.See ""The Code Book"" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, 
""Cryptonomicon"" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma 
cracking story, and pretty accurate.I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you 
see....Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma 
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma 
machines and brute-forcing.Eirikur

I wouldn't say that the societies of humans here before European occupancy
was 'lifted' by free xyz. Perhaps 'replaced' or 'sunk' or some other

societies is on average only marginally above poverty even today.

were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.--j.",Safe Email,"
